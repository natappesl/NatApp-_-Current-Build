                <p>
                    Free-tail bats prefer to live in caves, but they will also live under bridges, attics, or in abandoned buildings. They can also be found near bodies of water, since it attracts the insects that they eat.

                <p>
                    Some mating behavior for male Mexican free-tailed bats is that they sing to females during courtship. The females give birth to single pup in June or July. Baby bats can be found in the highest part of the caves where the temperature is the warmest; the warm conditions are essential for rapid growth and survival. In these "nurseries", the mother has to find her pup among thousands, which she does by recognizing its unique call.

                <p>
                    Free-tail bats eat large amounts of moths and other insects. Free-tailed bats have many predators, including:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Snakes</li>
                        <li>Raccoons</li>
                        <li>House cats</li>
                        <li>Owls</li>
                    </ul>
                    Baby bats are very vulnerable if they fall to the cave floor. Mothers will not rescue their young if they fall, giving predators an easy meal.
