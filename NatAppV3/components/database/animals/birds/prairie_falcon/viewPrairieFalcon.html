                <p>
                    In the summer, prairie falcons are typically found in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hilly Areas</li>
                        <li>Plains</li>
                        <li>Prairies</li>
                        <li>Grasslands</li>
                        <li>Deserts</li>
                    </ul>
                    In the winter, they can be found living in:
                    <ul>
                        <li>cultivated fields</li>
                        <li>lakeshores</li>
                        <li>desert and xeric scrublands</li>
                    </ul>
                    They avoid forested country and are rarly seen along the coast.

                <p>
                    Adult prairie falcons are extremely territorial during their mating season and will fight off intruding birds with loud sounds and attacks. The call of a prairie falcon is a loud "kree-kree-kree", which is usually heard when they are near their nests.

                <h1> Diet and Predators </h1>
                <p>
                    Prairie falcons mostly eat small birds and mammals. During their breeding season, their diet consists mostly of ground squirrels; during the winter when the ground squirrels become dormant, their diets shift to young songbirds.
